This is an attempt to make the lowest footprint possible tooltip plugin.

Features:
- uses element title as tooltip content
- supports dynamic content (uses live() )
- clean and lightweight 
- cross browser compatible (IE6+, FF2+, Opera9.5+, Chrome 3+)
- tooltip gets automatically repositioned if it would be displayed outside browser window
- tooltip width is restricted to 50% window size
- it's tiny - when minified less than 1kb, gzipped around 500 bytes

Usage example:

$.fn.jQLiteTip('.tooltip');
